            In the next few weeks we will be transitioning all of our customers to Copperheadâ€™s new licensing platform.  We will be rolling this out to our existing customers in a staggered schedule to ensure stability.  If you experience errors during this transition contact your reseller or support@copperhead.co        </info>
