        <info>To activate your device on our licensing platform you’ll need an active license. Licenses will be activated based on your purchase of CopperheadOS and who you purchased it from. If you’ve purchased a device from us or an authorized reseller, please select the box as noted in the screenshot. If there are any issues with this and you’re absolutely certain you purchased from an authorized source process please contact support@copperhead.co. If you’ve purchased from an authorized reseller and there are issues, contact them.</info>
        <info>Please note that we’ve experienced illegal licensing in the past and while we’ll work to ensure all of our customers are transitioned on to the new platform, we cannot guarantee that a device purchased from a non-authorized reseller will be guaranteed access.</info>
